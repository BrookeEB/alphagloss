# AlphaGloss

Alphabetizes my latex glossary entries.

Copy the glossary text to the clip board and run the program.  Outputs a time stamped text file of the new glossary and places the new glossary on the clip board.

Takes latex glossary entries of the format:

\newglossaryentry{value}
{
    name=value,
    description={Measure of benefit provided by a good or service},
}

Your mileage may vary.
